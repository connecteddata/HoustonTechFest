      <summary>Project Manager/Solution Architect, Retail Energy Services Company
Led a team to design and develop a solution to drive a strategic sales channel’s marketing campaigns through an audited and controlled process. The system was comprised of a SharePoint front end integrated with a SQL Server database via SSIS packages and ETL processes.  SharePoint lists and user experience provided the sales team insight into prospect categorization and segmentation. Prospects were classified systematically via interaction with existing customer data stores, U.S. Census Bureau geographic shape data (municipal, village, borough, and county boundaries), Bing Maps API, and application of business rules including geometric segmentation via SQL Server’s spatial data capabilities and implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium methods.

Project Manager/Solution Architect, Oil and Gas Drilling Resources firm
Architected a solution and led a team of developers that transformed data from the financial component of Oracle EBS to a Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model.  Providing both a Tabular and Multidimensional Analysis Services cube, along with SSRS reports and PowerView data visualizations, financial controllers at the firm were able to visualize, browse, and analyze line item detail in a mosaic and once seemly impossible ways.  The analysis completed from this tool allowed the client to discover $500K in unrecognized revenue, unveiled timing issues with receipt of costs and revenue recognition.  In addition it increased auditing accuracy, highlighted issues with data quality and allowed the firm to govern operations of under-performing warehouses.</summary>
